Sara	Waste of money	Waste of money. I got this to replace my fitbit. The step tracker is WAY off. Super low! For example just this morning I was deep cleaning and moving heavy furniture for like 3 hours.. every time I looked at my watch it kept telling me it was time to start moving! It had me at 109 steps the entire time I was cleaning.. it never went up. And the heart rate monitor is also way off. I was working out and it was at 68 to 70 when in reality it was up around 150. Wish I hadn't got rid of my Fitbit for this junk	1.0	0.5807802872452128
Ali	Holds No Battery	I purchased this watch because I love the look. I take a workout class (Orange Theory) regularly. There's no option to select a HIIT (high intensity interval workout) so I have to change the workout from running to elliptical to circuit training, which is fairly annoying. Also, this devise runs out of battery very quickly. I have to charge it every day. I don't really check it during the day, but without fail the battery drains. Without much use, I found that the watch was at 35% AT BEST when I came home from work. Not only that, the charger I received wasn't recognized and when I contacted Samsung via the chat feature, they recommended another charger for a 46mm watch and it's still hard to charge. Now the watch doesn't recognize the charger Samsung recommended. I hope I can return this because I really regret purchasing this.	1.0	0.688798390976797
PartyOfFive	Battery life is poor	I have to say I’m a bit disappointed with this watch. I had high hopes for it. I was looking to switch from my Apple Watch because I like the style of this Watch better. My main issue, Poor battery life. On a full charge it will last less then 2 days. That’s with minimal use. My Apple Watch lasts on a full battery 4 days between charges.  Another issue I have with it is I cannot answer phone calls. Really? I’ll be sticking with my Apple Watch!	2.0	2.4513625214840293
Jill W.	Battery Life is Terrible & Finicky Activity Tracking	I've had this watch for four months now, and it keeps getting buggier. The battery life is 15 hours at very best, so I've never been able to use this for any of the sleep tracking features. If you're using GPS, you can count on about 4 hours of GPS usage before the watch dies. I took it on a hike in CO, and it died before I finished, losing all my data. The Samsung Health app something picks up my activity, sometimes not. I linked my watch to Strava to track my marathon training progress, and it frequently disconnects in the middle of my runs. The touchscreen can take three taps to pause or restart an activity. I would not recommend this watch for an active user. However, if you're just looking for a smartwatch, I'm sure it's fine.	3.0	3.071572402676286
Ryan Pedersen	Not great for serious runners.	I loved the aesthetics of the watch, and the apps, but the fitness tracking is worthless.  Regularly stopped tracking pace and distance in the middle of my runs and would not "catch back up."  Very inconsistent and unreliable.  If you just need a smartwatch, the one is awesome, if you are an athlete, get a Garmin.	3.0	2.516965437193067
RuthB	Good and Bad	PROS: I love the feel and size of the watch. I have tiny wrists with a prominent bony bump, so I rarely wore my previous Samsung watch because big bulky watches are too uncomfortable to wear.  The usability is fine. The smooth, sleek look is great! CONS: It did not come with any kind of charger. NADA. WTF??  And battery life is not great.	4.0	4.428847593310826
Gatefan1565	Great Watch	Bought this for my daughter for her birthday. She has been wanting a watch to track her steps and have a watch. We are a Samsung family and she deserved a great gift. Having a Samsung S2 watch, I knew of several ways to save battery life and to set up the watch. Battery Life: So far she is hitting about 60% by the end of the day as she uses. I have the screen brightness set to 5 or 6. I also taught her how to turn on and off the "Wake up gesture" which can activate while walking, running, or moving around, which can drain the battery life. Set Up: Unfortunately, that took a little bit longer than I had planned. However, that was my fault, not the watches. I simply pulled it out, turned it on, and then worked on connecting it to my daughter's Samsung Note 8. I did not pull out the directions or even look at them. Even still, I knew the basis of what needed to be done. I muddled through it and had it connected in about 10 minutes. (Probably could have cut that in half if I had looked at the directions) The rest dealt with Samsung Health. After getting an account set up for my daughter, the watch seamlessly integrated with the phone with no issues.  Overall: I am happy with the watch and most importantly, my daughter loves it. I prefer the turning dial on the S2 so, if I were to get a new watch now, it would be the Samsung Watch 42mm version because the Samsung Watch Active does not have that satisfying, turning, dial on the face.	4.0	4.064182941340002
SteelTX	This is the best value for the money	Love everything about this watch.  Bought 2 Fitbit Versa watches and sent those back for horrible bluetooth for music.  These are excellent and flawless.  Love the sleep tracker, step tracker, heartbeat monitor, stress tracker, and music player!  Battery life is not as bad as I thought reading reviews.  Just charge it for an hour or two a day and it's good to go.  Would be nice if it lasted longer, but everything else about the watch is perfect!	4.0	4.4523738176782235
REC	Love this watch	Love this watch. It has literally everything you'd want or need in a smartwatch, but is super easy to use & navigate. If I had anything to complain about, it does drop bluetooth connection after just walking a room or 2 away. Kind of annoying if that's an important feature for you. I'd highly recommend watch & seller.	4.0	4.083515723231787
MrsRetailTherapy	Great for nursing students...	I wish the touch screen went from edge to edge to give us a little more space but other than that I love it. Super sleek and professional looking. I got it for nursing school to make my life a little easier. So far it has helped me with military time, patient respiration, etc... I can't have my phone out during clinicals and being able to respond to my kids on my wrist makes me feel so much better. Love it!	5.0	5.00880180254442
B_Stock	Tons of Features in This Slim Watch	My first smartwatch/fitness tracker and I'm extremely happy with it! Initially went with a less expensive product, but it was bulky and not as responsive as this watch. Built in microphone, can choose to receive notifications from phone, tons of workout options for tracking, and the list goes on. After having in on for 12hrs now the battery is at 63%. Looking forward to trying out all of the features.	5.0	5.013066515193719
Jeffrey Fahndrich	So... I guess it's pretty much perfect	I've had the Gear Fit2 since June 2016 and was looking to upgrade. I saw the splashy event Samsung held for this in February 2019, and had to get it. My largest reason (besides the fact that the Gear Fit2 will inevitably die) was for the aesthetic upgrade. The Gear Fit2 was very "Hey I'm wearing a fitness watch!" with its long, rectangular curve wrapping partially around the wrist. The Samsung Galaxy Active says "Hey I'm wearing a ... watch!"  Coming from the Gear Fit2, I see that all of its fitness-focused features are integrated into the new Galaxy Active, and yet it also manages to be a better smart watch generally. The watch's appearance is sleek and understated, the screen itself is gorgeous, the materials feel high-quality, the fit and feel for me are spot-on, the watch is snappier to wake up from inactive, it's easy and intuitive to navigate and customize--it is in every way an upgrade.  I initially had a problem where the heart rate sensor would not turn off even if I said Auto HR Settings "Never"--but realized this is due to the new Stress app (the watch's default for Auto Stress Settings is "Always"--do yourself and your battery a favor and turn that off). Now the heart rate sensor (the super bright green light under the watch that flashes rapidly) only turns on every 10 minutes (the "Frequent" setting under Auto HR Settings).  I am hoping my opinion does not change over time because I've definitely got that "5 star" feeling :-D	5.0	5.0183949904658975
David R.	Great watch for a great price and good functions.	Really nice watch pretty accurate and easy to use, I've had apple watch GPS before and I'd say this Galaxy Watch Active is pretty much the same but cheaper, so it is totally worth it also really helpful during the workout and water resistant as well.	5.0	5.074263696462163
Amazon Customer	This Farmer loves it.	Love it.My eyes are getting old, so appreciate the variety of clock faces.Also being able to tap face 3x to enlarge any screen.(this feature needs to be turned on in settings).Im a farmer so i put it on charge once a day while milking though i reckon i would get 2days before needing to charge. Looking forward to Blood pressure feature when released in my region. Also like the ease in which i can record my cycling. Also I like the sleep app.very interesting to study my data.	5.0	5.274505229329854
Stef Nevells	Great smart watch, does it all	Works great with my android phone. It's the perfect pairing of fitness watch and smart watch. The fitness tracking features are easy to use, accurate, and offer a wide variety. The phone features work great, are easy to use, and allow access to all essential phone functions. I use mine primarily as a step counter, cycling computer, and to text. Visually, I like it a lot. It's big enough to see everything but small enough to be comfortable and aesthetically  pleasing for everyday wear.	5.0	5.301056643996896
Bob & Michelle	Don't wait like I did - Buy it!	Fantastic lightweight feel and so many features! I've been shopping for a smart watch for longer than I care to admit.  I'm so happy I didn't settle! I've had this for about a month now and am still finding fun new settings and features. The battery life lasts me 3 full days, depending on use & settings. Love the size, the fact its waterproof, and ultra lightweight feel of the watch!	5.0	5.315330534792243
G Byrd	Great value, Great watch	I tried Lots of "smart watches" before I finally settled on the Samsung Active. I liked this better than the regular Samsung watch for a couple reasons. I like the size of the Active. It's not bulky like the regular one. I don't miss the rotating bezel. Second reason I like it better is the price. More reasonably priced for the differences being so minimal. The Galaxy Wearable app is basic and easy to use. I prefer the Facer app for watch faces. You can even make your own watch face with the Facer App. I've changed out watch bands too just for esthetics and it was easy to do. The battery life has been about 24 hours. I dim the screen a tad, and I don't have lots of extra sport tracking on it. I use mine mostly for tracking steps and notifications and quick replies with out having to access my phone. Bixby is a pretty neat feature too. Bixby is similar to Siri or Alexa. I can tell Bixby to text or call someone for me. Easy Peasy. Overall I love my watch, only thing that would make it perfect would be longer battery life.	5.0	5.062039044103823
amazing game	Great product and service.	The smartwatch is brand new; the package was protecting the watch very well, too. On the other hand, Amazon prime through FedEx have a fast shipping process. I am so happy with the watch and the service. I recommended it.	5.0	5.022856254405523
blessedgirl	LOVE it!	I got this today and really love how it looks and feels so far.  It works great too, it has the same functionality as the Gear Sport as far as I can tell and is .1 smaller on the screen size with no rotating bezel.  It will be more comfortable to sleep in than the Sport I had before.  You can't take calls on it but can talk into text just like the Gear Sport and it seems pretty accurate and keeps the text history.  There's nothing about it I don't like so far but I'll come back and update if I discover something.  The charger is a USB so I can use my phone charger, computer or car and the part that attaches to the watch is as small as the watch face and is a magnet to click on the back.  For the price this is a fantastic smart watch but as the Gear Sport comes down in price you can choose between the 2 based on if you just want a rotating bezel or not... I don't miss it I didn't really use it that much anyway.	5.0	5.023413453144359
Amazon Customer	Perfect fit and great performance	I've got the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active because of his reduced size compared to other smartwatches. It is perfectly comfortable and very light to wear. The wrist band folds under itself avoiding it to flip while exercising. The heartbeat monitoring and step-count is pretty accurate, and so the workout track. I've wore it everyday for the past 2 month, using it at the swimming pool 3 times at week. It detects the swimming style and it keeps an accurate count of laps and resting time. Contrarily to other reviewers, I didn't experience any weird episode like over-warming or short life battery (I need charge it every 2 days), neither damage of band or screen. Highly recommended!	5.0	4.82151540000202
Joy Onstad	Works great!	I love this fitness watch! I'm not a crazy athlete, someone in the gym every day, but I'm working on it. The watch helps make tracking everything just a little easier without having my phone attached to me at all times. I enjoy the Spotify app too, I can go for a run and easily swap songs. Or use my Strava app to record my walk/runs & distance, etc. Plus it's pretty! I couldn't be happier :)	5.0	5.016170783309107
shana	Samsung Galaxy sport	Shipped super fast. I was surprised that I still use this after many months every day. I know I haven't even tapped into its full potential, but for my need, i.e steps, time, heart rate, emails, texts, social media, calculator, weather, calendar - it's perfect. Everything is right on my wrist. The water proof is a nice feature for being caught in the rain. The band is easily cleaned as it is a soft rubber material. I like the customization of it, too. Well worth the money even for the few apps that I personally use. There are so many more available for other users.	5.0	4.651570059072568
Daniel Moulden	Awesome	Absolutely love this watch. Battery life is two days with normal use, six days with power saver mode. It's helping me get my health back under control with stress monitoring, sleep tracking as well as the reminders to be active throughout the day or to slow down and breathe when I'm stressed out. I also find I'm on my phone a lot less because I get notifications on the watch which let's me know if it's something I really need to answer (usually not!).  Highly recommended.	5.0	4.684365618962791
Kharley813	LOVE THIS!	I just got this watch for my birthday last month, and I am obsessed with it. It works so well. The battery life lasts a little over 24 hrs. It connects seamlessly with my Samsung Galaxy S8. I would recommend it to anyone. I even have my girlfriend who is an Apple user wanting this watch since it pairs with IOS.	5.0	4.918862976632832
Heather	Love!	No complaints! I was looking forward to better use of my Samsung Health program and I got what I was looking for. Great watch face designs and more can be added via Galaxy store and an app called Facer. I also purchased additional straps and faces for my watch to give it different looks as well. Love, love, love!	5.0	4.644304696675791
R. Phelps	Great Galaxy Gadget	I've been wearing my Samsung Galaxy Watch Active a couple of weeks ago and I love it! I also have a Galaxy phone and I love how they interact together Some of my favorite functions include the sleep tracker, the heartrate monitor, and the ability to see my calendar and the weather. But my favorite thing is being able to see my text messages and emails just by glancing at my watch. This is especially helpful in the workplace, where you don't want to be seen on your phone all the time. You can even use your watch to reply! I also LOVE that I can add pictures to the gallery. I have a daughter and love to show her off and this is even easier than getting out my phone or printed pictures. The watch is lightweight and unobtrusive so it's easy to wear all the time. I can be pretty clumsy, but there are no scratches or dings so it seems pretty durable as well. The only thing I dislike is the battery life. The battery lasts me about a day and a half, so I have to charge it almost nightly if I don't want to get the low battery warning. Overall, I'm very happy with the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active and have been taking every opportunity I have to show it off. I would definitely recommend this to fellow Galaxy lovers looking to upgrade their tech experience.	5.0	5.351936151555733
Abraham Tehrani	One of the best smartwatches out there!	This is one of the best smartwatches out there! I got this as a gift for my wife and she loves the color! She also likes that it does not look masculine. She enjoys the tracking for her sleep and workouts. She also likes getting her notifications and text messages. The battery life can be up to 2 days.	5.0	5.409784533256236
Wyatt Johnson	Great smartwatch	I've had the Galaxy Watch active for a few months now and I absolutely love it. I've bumped it around a little and it's come out pristine, it is very durable. I usually have between 55% and 65% battery left st the end of a day so this watch could easily last you two full days. Overall I would say that this is a great smart watch for the price.	5.0	5.470356997952226
justice	Nice watch	Bought for husband and he loves everything about it. He’s not a tech guy but needed this. He doesn’t miss any calls now because he wears this watch. He’s in and out of hospital s all day and while making deliveries he has to turn his phone on silent. This is a perfect option. At least he will know that someone called	5.0	5.230077231659338
Krystal Pack	Love it	The watch completely met my expectations. The only complaint I have is that sometimes it says my workouts are completed mid workout or tries to start a work out while I am driving, but neither of those are big deals to me.	5.0	4.9162541199025345

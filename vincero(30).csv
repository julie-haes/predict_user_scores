Justin	Low Quality Watch	Disappointed with the quality of the watch itself, specifically the band. The case or head feels heavy but the band does not feel like acceptable quality for a watch at this price point. It is stiff yet flimsy at the same time.  I got this watch along with, I assume many others when it was a Amazon Deal of the Day for $100. It is not worth the price listed currently. The logo on the face also appears cloudy in my watch.  I am also concerned about the level of fake reviews for this product. Do your own research ahead of time before buying this watch.	1.0	1.0842117684582102
RJ	Watch Band Small	The watch is nice but the watch band is small and thick. I have an average wrist but it is very difficult to latch. I returned it	2
Mike Weeks	Not as good as reviews.	The calendar doesn’t work and has to be reset every day. The leather band is so stiff and hard to put on. I have even used olive oil to soften it. I have to reset the time everyday. Not very pleased with this watch. I thought for the price it would be much better.	3.0	3.271752202394701
AV	good quality watch but straps are not good	Used for 1.5 years (not a daily wear - I rotate between another 5-6 watches before I wear this) . Strap quality is subpar.  I have cheaper watches whose straps have lasted more than 5 years with minimal wear.  Bezel has scratches, but the dial is looks great.	3.0	3.0998176165012366
Hellraiser1	Like many other posts	Like many other posts, the wrist band is stiff and just barely fits my wrist on the last hole, not much of a surprise .  The watch itself is elegant and classy, looks more like $1000 watch.	4.0	4.3916921163911145
fastjohnie	The packaging is simple but nice. Looks and feels to be of nice quality	Watch arrived on time. The packaging is simple but nice. Looks and feels to be of nice quality. I have worn it once. The leather band is stiff as expected.  I will write another review after i have had this watching for awhile.	4.0	4.160970734659537
Randy24	Beautiful watch; date-setting instructions---not so much	This is a beautiful watch!  Large face (40mm), dark blue background with gold hands, simple day of month date window, comfortable leather band. I deducted one star because the instructions on setting the date were totally wrong. I searched online to find how to set the date with no luck but finally figured it out myself by fiddling with the crown settings. Frustrating! Someone should have caught that in the quality control dept.	4.0	3.5266076198293272
KEN F.	Veritable magnificent craftsmanship.	I have recently purchased three Vincero watches for my family - everyone was extremely impressed and amazed that these high-quality watches were so very reasonably priced; The plating and distinctive faces are superb. I intend to purchase more items for friends and family in the near future. Compared to companies such as Citizen and Seiko, these time pieces are without equal. An extremely delighted  consumer.

Adam Jones	Great looking watch for a really cheap price	Definitely a good watch for the extremely cheap price of $140. Bought it to tide me over until I feel like buying a real expensive watch from the jewelry store in town and I'm definitely happy with it. Looks as advertised and the Italian leather is extremely comfortable.	5.0	5.1000473670321504
Robert Rochon	Superb watch at a great value!	Superb watch at a great value! I'm very pleased with the watch, the look, and the feel. I'm in the process of updating my wardrobe and buying this watch is one of my first steps in doing so, and I have no regrets. I will recommend Vincero watches to my friends.	5.0	4.883869644955128
Anthony	Beautiful inexpensive watch!	A beautiful simplistic watch with an amazing design. This is my first time buying jewelry online and for myself. I have received several compliments about its looks.  I'm happy with this product recommend 5 / 5	5.0	5.023002890492849
James N. Smith	A Solid Watch.	I really like this watch, and I get compliments on it all the time.  Keeps very good time, has a nice conservative look that goes well with most occasions. Not simply a "good watch for the price" item, but a solidly good watch that does what a watch is supposed to do.  If you don't need the bells and whistles, you can't go wrong with this Vincero.	5.0	5.0623495587417064
R. R. Anderson	gift for picky hubby, he loves Kairtos!	Initially bought my hubby one of your Kairos watches, it has a brown leather band with a blue face, and he loves it so much I bought him another Kairos watch with a black leather band.  He is picky about his watches and he absolutely loves your brand!	5.0	5.052969962456605
Nels brown	Simple and stylish	This is an attractive and apparently well made watch at a reasonable price. The band is sharp looking and seems to be something that will hold up over time. The time piece is functional and has a classic style that appears elegant because of it's simplicity. I've only owned this watch for a week, but I am happy with the purchase.	5.0	5.231609486868941
A. Vanskiver	Great timepiece	Great timepiece! I've owned this watch for several weeks now and it's keeping great time as it should. The fit and finish are very good for a watch at this price point.  The leather band is substantial and it looks great dressed up for casual.	5.0	5.265825000203264
James P. Loyd	Great watch at a great price.	The watch is a great looking watch and is simple to use, unlike most watches today where you almost have to be a rocket scientist to figure out how everything works.  I love the watch	5.0	4.90612566934429
George Gerich	Sophistication for an affordable price	This is a classy watch at an un-classy price. Solid construction, but very lightweight on the arm. I like the heavy duty watchband that should last a long time. The face and hands of the watch are delicate and well-designed. Here's hoping that it's also durable - time will tell.	5.0	4.662400433829208
Alex Pickles	Overall very happy with the product!	Very good looking watch, came in a nice, professional looking box. You can definitely tell it’s a luxury watch with a resonable price. My only concern is the Italian leather fits kind of weird on my wrist, but I did only just recently receive the watch, maybe after some time the leather will break in and feel better.	5.0	4.660447289471757
Tony Adamich	Perfect everyday watch that'll still turn heads	This was exactly what I was looking for - a simple, elegant watch for a very reasonable price. The face turned out to be a much prettier white than the online pic made it out to be. The band is nice and strong, I tend to wear the hell out of them so thin and flimsy isn't my first choice. I only needed a date complication (why are there so many out there that don't have this) so that was perfect. It's already turned several heads - Would very much recommend this!	5.0	5.004315784184205
T. J. R.	Good Value	I have had the watch for a week or so. It functions well. It has the look and feel of quality, The strap is really nice leather and it looks like a much more expensive watch but not flashy. Perfect.	5.0	4.610104750695381
tsjacket	Looks great!	Good looking watch with an easy-to-read dial. The date was easy to set. Leather band looks like nice quality, although a little stiff. I'm sure it will get softer in time. Can't comment on accuracy yet since I just started wearing it. So far, I like it a lot!	5.0	4.799751494964621
Courtney Cochran	Quality and Care	I ordered this watch for my husband last week and have to say that we are extremely impressed. Not only is the quality of this watch amazing, especially for the affordable price, but the customer service displayed by this company is top notch. I would absolutely recommend them to a friend and will be purchasing from them in the future!	5.0	4.892967102498922
Amazon Customer	High quality product at a fair price	Despite being a fairly new brand, Vincero has already figured out how to put out quality products at an afordable price. The Kairos watch I purchased looks great, feels great, and performs great. Im sure ill be adding another Vincero to my collection soon.	5.0	4.934410215174217
Raegan Thomas	Design	I bought this for my boyfriend on the occassion of our one year anniversary. I am so excited to give this watch to him because it is even more beautiful than I thought it would be. I can’t wait to see his face when he receives it! It’s design is awesome and I love the deep blue face contrasted against the genuine leather wrist band.	5.0	5.005452621832016
ct Bowes	Great watch at the best value - 5/5	I got this watch about a week ago and could not be happier! The sapphire glass is a nice treat at an affordable price and the watch looks great in both casual wear and with a suit. The band is very high quality leather and can easily be switched out if you have other Vincero watches. The watch has a nice weight, heavy enough so you know it is quality made without weighing you down. This and the Chrono S are now my go to watches over several other well-known brands. I could not be happier with my purchase, you cannot find a better piece at this price anywhere. Highly recommend and 5/5 stars.	5.0	5.144855613272728
norman rosen	Just pperfect	Absolutly love the watch not only does it look better than watches I have that were thousands of dollars more, but the leather strap is beautiful. Wanted a watch that tells time not moon positions this is it. Next I will be looking for one very thin. Keep up the good work	5.0	5.2236920775882965
Alexis Iturbe	The beauty of the watch	I love the fact that the watch was exactly what I read on the description. I also love the marble on the back of the watch. One thing that this watch is best at is the fact that you can change the straps of it to either  leather, or metal to just change up your like in taste of different combinations. The price for this watch and any watch that Vincero sell you is just right and it will be worth your money instead of buying other watches for a greater expense.	5.0	5.360750469378649
Kevin Paciulli	Amazing looking watch!	Just got this as a present, and all I can say is wow! I have many watches - but this one is my new favorite. You can tell it is made of very high quality material the second you open it. The dial is stunning, the leather is high quality. Very easy to set and read - a real head turner! Looks like a $600 watch	5.0	5.453443926282505
Agatha	Beautiful	I bought this watch for my husband as a Christmas gift and he really loved it! It's really beautiful and he put it on right away and has worn it every day since. I think he was impressed by the quality of the packaging and the sleek beauty of the watch itself. The blue face is really stunning.	5.0	5.317101571266407

Amazon Customer	Not worth the hassle	The strap is really hard to change. I managed to detach one strap but I am not able to attach the larger strap so the product is now useless. I watched a YouTube video on how to attach it and let others try as well. No one was able to attach the strap. Even the video wonders why Fitbit would make it so hard to attach. You have to line up these three tiny pins in three different directions simultaneously. The pins are so delicate they can easily be bent making the product impossible to use. Right now it is so hard to attach that we are not sure if that hasn happened. Similarly if one tiny delicate pin on the charging port is bent it also cannot be charged.	1.0	0.5268965730690445
Aubrey	Listen to the poor reviews	I've used fitbit products for years. My well loved charge 2 has stopped synching so decided perhaps I should upgrade. I read poor reviews but thought maybe they had received a bad watch so went to Target to buy one and try it out. Charged for 3 hours, screen never even blinked. Made sure alignment of pins was good, tried 3 different bricks and several outlets. Nothing. Exchanged for another one, exact same experience. The quality of their products is very questionable as of late and customer service does little bit offer trying to power cycle defective units. These are common concerns from what I've read and I'll be looking for a different brand now.	1.0	0.6878643701302667
Amazon Customer	It stopped working after 3 months	My fitbit stopped working after 3 months. The screen does not work or respond to touch. Sometimes, it turns itself on or off without being prompted to do so. It still tracks my sleep somehow, but I'm not able to access the other features because the screen part is broken and unresponsive. I'm really upset, this was one of the more expensive fitness trackers on the market and I expected more in terms of quality from this.	2.0	2.005358808272259
Sophia	scratched and not that great	I have had this watch for less than a month and it is already damaged. The screen got scratched on my kitchen counter. If it cannot even handle the indoors, how will it handle a hike?  It seems less accurate than the alta. I have steps before I even get out of bed. That never happened with the alta. And my alta never got damaged anyway I had it for many many years. I gave it to my mom when I got this one so it still works.  I wanted more features like the heart rate monitor but it was not worth the upgrade. Sure, it does more but why? Why do I need those things?	3.0	3.050132020087251
Cassandra Reising	All in all a good watch	I have had this for about a month and am very happy with it. Battery life is amazing. I have just started running with it. I ran the same route on two days and distance was .35miles different. I  am not too stuck on distance/time so it wasn't a big deal to me. I wish there were more compatible watch apps available. Would love to be able to use amazon music. Also wish music control for other devices could pause the music. Those are my biggest complaints. All in all a good smart watch.	4.0	3.9999381694181495
Gearhead	Works as designed.	Bought this for my girlfriend. Thought I was tech savvy but had to read on its functionality. It’s a little quirky at first to get music apps installed, to playback. You must have your phone nearby as all apps run through phone. Not a standalone device. It tracked her sleep one night but she wasn’t wearing it. Still trying to understand that. Other than that seems to work fine for texting, emails, notifications.	4.0	4.057881070138249
speedemonj	Great for fitness	Great for fitness, sleep, etc but you have to use the app on your phone for a lot of things to input. I really wish it had a feature to answer the phone through the watch. You can answer the phone but have to use the phone to actually talk.	4.0	4.112775079400297
Tyler	Good bang for your buck	I had a Fitbit blaze before I got the versa 2 and I loved it! The only thing that I wasn’t a big fan of was that it wasn’t waterproof, just water resistant. However, the versa 2 is awesome! It is much more customizable and is waterproof. The only thing I’m not a big fan of is the ability to play music from it because I only use Apple Music and it doesn’t work with that. Also, the free version of Fitbit coach is horrible and Fitbit has done nothing to fix it.	4.0	4.344578190051397
Kindle Customer	HUGE improvement over the first Fitbit Versa	My first Fitbit Versa was great and died 4 months in (and I was still paying for it!).  No amount of restarting would fix it.  This Versa 2 is fantassssstic.  Super accurate. My favorite feature is the sleep tracking as it was with the original Fitbit Versa.  Still learning about all the cool new features but it's been a great purchase so far.	5.0	4.5026695940464005
Nicole Quigley	Love It!!	After buying a cheaper type of fitness tracker on Amazon and absolutely hated it, I decided to treat myself and go with a fit bit. I absolutely love it for tracking my steps, water and calories. It really motivates me to watch what I eat, keep drinking water, and keep moving. I wouldn’t suggest buying anything other than a fit bit. It keeps at least a 4 day charge and when you do need to charge it, it charges quickly!!	5.0	4.95599574273193
Amazon Customer	Versa 2 is amazing	Amazing sleep tracking and great step and heart rate accuracy!!! I’ve come from Garmin devices and Fitbit seems to be more accurate and the app is wayyyyy better!! Paired with a Spigen case, I never take it off and it’s very comfortable!	5.0	4.512607084501644
Hal	Simple and nice	It’s pretty sleek. Sleep tracking doesn’t always track sleep though. I. Price the Fitbit charge 3 tracked sleep better. Battery life is about 2ish days with clock display always on. The features to use Spotify and what not is nice. It’s a shame Apple prevents the quick replies because I hated Apple Watch. This tracker is a nice simple but cool tool	5.0	5.0206461273986935
Heather	Great purchase!	Very impressed with the features and comfort of this device. Tracks exercise and sleep automatically. App stores all info and has easy to add food calorie counts. Cute watch faces available for cheap purchase prices. The band is very comfortable and I hardly know I’m wearing it. Good battery life. Syncs well with my iPhone and displays calls and messages. Would buy again.	5.0	5.031151183534693
jessica albrecht	I LOVE THE VERSA 2.	I love it! It's cute, comfortable, and works really well! Having to have it connected via bluetooth runs my battery down on my phone but other than that it's a pretty neat watch. I like that it reminds me to stay active throughout the day and it has a neat feature that reminds you to breathe and it walks you through a breathing technique that helps you relax.	5.0	5.0435134680831455
K Olds	Happy with the change to Fitbit Versa 2	LOVE my new Fitbit Versa 2 Easy to learn and very comfortable to wear. I have tiny arms so I was worried about the face size but its turned out fine even when dressing up. I am at the age that new technology isn't always my friend. I had my Samsung watch for a really long time so I was worried about the switch. My fears were unfounded and intact it's been so easy my husband got himself one also. I am looking forward to the merger with Google so I can retire Alexa. Recieved my order two days early. Packaged with no damage. I love my purple band :)	5.0	5.054810112447017
Nkie715	This watch, bad app	This watch is great, however, the Fitbit app keeps crashing! I've only had this watch 2 weeks and I've had to uninstall and reinstall the app at least 3 times to get the app to find my watch. That is the only solution for this issue according to the app in the Play store. Too bad Fitbit can't invest in the app as much as they have their trackers.	5.0	5.055352283791326
Eileen Jones	Quality product for a good price	I bought this item fairly quickly and without a lot of research. it was recommended in an article. It was delivered very quickly and I could not be more satisfied. It is super user-friendly. Easy to use. Any app is available. It does so much more than just tracking exercise and fitness. Very pleased	5.0	5.056387970120606
Skye Musacchia	Amazing	Absolutely love this watch!!!  I would highly recommend it to every one!!! Love the alexa I use her alot for grocery lists. (I'm good at writing them and leaving them on the counter) love keeping track of my hear rate and the friendly competitions with family members.	5.0	5.058110800925835
J. Wong	Sleep and weight tracking features are great	I am mainly writing a review of the sleep and weight tracking features as these are the main purpose I bought the device for.  From my personal experience, the Fitbit Versa 2 seems to track sleep patterns quite well as it matches how I feel about my sleep.  I think it's pretty accurate.  It tracks sleep in 4 stages; awake, REM, light and deep.  For each night, you would get a sleep rating from 1 to 100, with 100 being the best.  I don't know how the Versa 2 determines the different stages, but it does seem to know when I start and finish sleeping accurately.  The other feature I use is the weight tracking.  I linked my Versa 2 to the RENPHO Bluetooth Body Fat Scale and it now tracks my weight easily and seamlessly with the REPHO app.  Since I have had sleeping problems, it's great to see a graphical representation of my sleep patterns day over day so that I can better understand what's happening.  I'm sure Fitbit has a disclaimer on the accuracy of the data, but from my experience it seems correct.	5.0	5.060681148587504
Phillip Ezell	Great capability for a reasonable price.	I like the fitness and sleep tracking capabilities.  I was a little concerned about using it with an iPhone but the watch and app have performed well thus far.  The Fitbit Versa 2 has given me all the capabilities I was looking for at a much cheaper cost than Apple Watch and with much better battery life.	5.0	5.07554248873589
Debbie	I love it!	I love my Versa 2, but I can only compare it to my Alta HR, which I had been happy with. I love that I can change the screens, and there are a lot of free styles. I like to match the current holiday or season. I’ve had fall leaves, jack-o-lanterns, a turkey, and now Santa. I like that I can choose apps to get notifications from, that the screen is large enough to read the messages, and I can scroll back through past notifications. I also like that more information is included on the home screen.	5.0	5.077276007649587
Dreamersland	Love my Fitbit!!	Got it yesterday.  Super easy to set up, very intuitive.  I love the look and the feel of this one.  I have owned other Fitbits but I think this one is by far, my most favorite.  I love the look and the feel of the band.  I don't normally like the "plastic" bands but this one feels like soft leather.  It comes in the box with a large or a small.  I am currently using the small one.  I did order protective case for it so I don't nick the screen.  It is a bit bulky but still a favorite!	5.0	5.079997819998571
Katzapainter	Lots of info on this watch and very light weight	Love my Fitbit. Very light weight. Everything I need on the face of watch. I put my look alike girl (. ) on the face and have enjoyed all the things she does. I was having coffee with my sisters and she popped up sitting in a cup of coffee. My sisters where cracking up. Love that I can read a text while walking. And the music. I just haven’t figured out how to answer the phone on it. Heart rate and sleep tracking are awesome	5.0	5.1128997655448005
Ashlyn Pond	Comfy and motivational! Highly recommend!	I love my watch so much, and didn’t realize how much I wanted this until my husband got it for me. This has so much motivation for me, I am obsessed with it and have not taken it off since. It tracks all of my steps, and if it over tracks, I recommend to put it on your left hand and put your settings to dominate. Or put it on the hand that you don’t use the most and then said it to dominant. It is truly one of the best gifts I’ve ever received!	5.0	5.1106512175738565
Sierra Wrathall	Best watch!	Amazing smart watch/ fitness tracker! Well worth the upgrade from my old fitbit. The charging, the sleep tracking, calorie tracking, weather, etc. Is all great. The voice reply to texts works really well and pretty accurate! Definitely recommend.	5.0	5.084164400108811
Taylor Meeks	The Best FitBit Ever!	What an awesome product!! I upgraded from the FitBit Charge 2 to the Versa 2, and I was extremely satisfied with the product. There is a slight learning curve becuase the Versa 2 is quite high tech, and the ‘upgrade’ and syncing the new FitBit to the app took about 45 minutes.Nevertheless, the Versa 2 is incredible!! I love the Alexa feature, the wallet feature, and all the fantastic FitBit features like sleep tracking and exercise features. The band it comes with is super comfortable, and hasn’t caused any skin irritations (but I take mine off to charge everyday, disinfect the bands, and leave it off for at least an hour). Keep in mind before I bought the Versa 2, I was already fluent with FitBit products. If you have fitbit products and are considering upgrading, upgrade to the Versa 2. You won’t be sorry!!	5.0	5.138476701600491
Pappy	My New Fitbit.	I have had several different Fitbit watches over the years but this one seems to be the best yet. Easy to use and find what you want. It can be customized to your liking. I really like the feature that when you turn your wrist and look at the watch it wakes up, unlike older models where you had to press a button to get the time. Highly recommend this model.	5.0	5.489930526195906
Jill Fowler	Happy with purchase	Happy with purchase.  Love having the insight right on my wrist.  Motivates me to be more active by getting my steps in and more conscious of my calorie consumption.  Only complaint is it has trouble syncing almost every morning.  Otherwise happy with purchase and glad I bought it.	5.0	5.402452714356095
BevD	Absolutely love the Fitbit Versa 2!	I purchased the Fitbit Versa 2 and I love it. It took me a few attempts to pair it with my Samsung Galaxy 10s+ 5G but I got it to work.  This watch makes me want to challenge myself and complete all my goals. I don’t usually wear any jewelry or watches to bed but I started wearing the Fitbit to track my sleep, it is very comfortable. Over all I am very pleased with my purchase.	5.0	5.2065769517856255
UberFoodie	Love this thing	I opted for this over an Apple Watch, because all I really need is the fitness tracker - for the price, this thing is a much better choice. This is my third (?) Fitbit product, so I saw no need to change anyway, they've always worked well for me. This thing is great - it's sleek, fits well, and has great apps and software. I use it with the MyFitnessPal app on my iPhone with no issues at all. It does everything I need it to do, plus a few whistles & bells: text & call notification, AM alarms, can change out the watch face & wristbands - all great. I do wish that the battery life was a bit longer - or gave me more notice when it's running low. An additional charger would also be a great option, but definitely not a dealbreaker. I'd absolutely purchase this again. If you're looking for a very stylish, super-functional fitness tracker that won't break the bank, this is the one.	5.0	5.170615250898586

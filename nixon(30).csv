WOLVES	Will not retain proper day of week	I followed the instructions out of box to set day. The day did not remain accurate for longer than 12 hours. Tried it the way it is described in these reviews  (midnight as opposed to setting it at noon) also didn't work. It took me a while to remember to set it on a night I happen to be awake and home at noon. Now I'm two weeks out of my exchange period. I have soo many watches I paid far less for and did no research on and pulled no tricks to set the day window and they remain accurate for years from the initial setting. Very disappointed with the brand. I should had listened to the reviews. It's a looker, but, also an expensive paper weight.	1.0	0.6080604510124314
yvm_22	Not what I expected.	Only 11 and 12 line positions illuminate when in dark environments. The rest doesn't lit up, not even the hands. I like watches that have certain weight to it but this one is very light. Out of the box had missing areas of the silver color bath around the vessel. It looks a very cheap watch.	2.0	1.8974873379873278
Amazon Customer	I absolutely love everything about the aesthetics of this watch	I absolutely love everything about the aesthetics of this watch. I've received many compliments and personally, I don't leave the house without this gem on my wrist. That being said. The first thing to break (quickly) was the band. I've needed it to be replaced three times now, from three different positions on the band. Additionally, the date module has also broken (all within a year of purchase) so I'm stuck attempting to read the day of the week in Spanish. Not a terribly serious problem but if you're going to spend $150 on a watch, it should work properly for at least a few years.	3.0	2.8596389454684177
Tyler Archibald	Days didn't work at first	When I first opened the box and tried setting the date and time the hands and date worked fine, but the day was stuck on "TUE". After I spun the hour hands enough the day started to change to the correct day and I guess that fixed it so now everything works like it is supposed to. Looks great. Thick leather band. Comfortable.	4.0	3.842107631887609
A. Velasco	Beautiful watch but glitchy date mechanism	this watch was given to me as a gift and i was beyond enamored with the look of the watch. it just looks great and the materials are solid. unfortunately the date mechanism is a bit glitchy- it wont turn even if you are spinning the knob sometimes and it isn't perfectly aligned. if it weren't for this I would give it five stars, but it is a minor inconvenience.	4.0	4.0205314310469955
Thuan Vu	Sentry leather, my second Nixon.	Similar to my other sentry, this watch keeps perfect time.  Unlike my other one, the leather offers a different look.  More casual, but sophisticated enough to go with my everyday work attire.  I've yet to wear it to an upscale party, but I'm sure it will look great while I wear a blazer and nice button up.  It just stands out with clean dial and quality looking leather strap.	4.0	4.45004594334071
Spacecookies4	Generally very happy with this watch	Generally very happy with this watch. Get a lot of complements! After a little over a month, I have noticed some of the stitching on the band has come loose. I'm waiting to hear from the Nixon service department to see how this can be addressed.	4.0	3.9339180359970105
Matt Holloway	Noice!	I have many watches, and this one is my favorite. The watch face is the perfect size, it's not too small but not huge and bulky either. It's very comfortable, and the color scheme is exceptional. I got blue with the brown band. It's lightweight, which is nice. I don't have anything negative to say about the watch, definitely worth the money in my opinion, I would purchase again.	5.0	4.6952596764165335
Kevin Simpson	Solid Watch, Looks Phenomenal	This is the first watch I've bought for myself. I wanted something versatile that I can wear in the office, out on the town, or casually and that would still have a place in my wardrobe after expanding my collection. This watch definitely fits the bill. I really love how the machined and brushed metal of the watch looks with the light brown leather. I do wish the marking where whiter and "less I expect florescence green".	5.0	4.798002193930587
Amazon Customer	Good watch	The adjustable wrist strap was top-notch and the styling behind the design of the watch is exquisite especially for the price point. I have been looking for a replacement for my eight dollar Walmart watch for about a year now and I am much happier with this one. it is very very smooth like Bronze looking  inlay and Minute hand hour hand and second hand all move smooth	5.0	4.873467903675249
Jess	Great watch for the price!	Purchase this as a gift for my husband. I wanted something that looked nice but wasn’t overly fancy since I new he’d be wearing it for everyday (including to his mostly business-casual office and out in the golf course). It looks sharp and I like that the black face and brown bands makes it work with whatever neutral he chooses to wear.	5.0	5.1158500516591054
Amazon Customer	Great quality and a great price	I bought this for my boyfriend. I was a little worried because I had never bought from another manufacturer except for Nixon. However, I was extremely pleased with the watch. It came quickly and it looked just as it should! Beautiful and classy. I was super impressed with the quality and will not be weary to purchase these from this site again!	5.0	5.221441229995062
Andrew	Great Watch!	Would buy it again! Get many compliments on it.  Things I like:  The hour marks on the face are raised. Just looks cooler. Very classic. Weight is good too, it's a bigger watch, but doesn't weigh that much  Things I don't like:  The hour and minute hands glow, but not very well. Not anything that should sway your decision, but somewhat disappointing.  Overall,  Good brand, good price. Currently the watch is at Nordstoms and it is roughly 30% less on Amazon. Had the watch for 2 months and no complains. Cosmetically it looks like it just came out of the box. Good classic looking watch. I have 5 other watches and this is my go to when I dress casually. I would reccommend you to buy it!! You won't regret it	5.0	4.83267143201416
frank	I love this watch	I love this watch, it looks great on me and it's not too big or small. It's meant to go on your right wrist. Note the rotary switch. Your dates comes in three languages. It's real easy to change though. It stays in English if you wish to. Over all great product with quality finish. Worth the money.	5.0	4.829172487985382
Michael B.	Classy, elegant and sexy ass watch!	I wasn't sure what to expect. You can't really go by product pics but I did. Let me add that I'm glad I did. This watch is so elegant and classy looking! Can be dressed up or down with no problem. I think I might be a Nixon fan from now on. Love it!	5.0	4.622924472269784
caliali89	Great Watch	I bought this as a gift for my fiance and he has not taken it off.  The color & quality is great.  You can read the date clearly and the face is on the larger side so it's easy to read.  So far the straps have held up really well considering he wears it daily.	5.0	4.80677474329197
Doug	Classically stylish!	Great looking, simple, nice watch that you will constantly get compliments on. It's one of those classic looks that is also functional and stylish. I liked this watch so much I now have 2, one with a black leather band and one with a dark brown and wear at least one, if not both, with my outfit every day.	5.0	5.126051878458801
Amazon Customer	Nixon watches are great!	I bought this watch for my boyfriend and he loves it! The watch is very nicely made and has eye catching features. He gets compliments on it all the time with its very classic look. I ordered it with the brown leather band and blue face which is a bit different in a good way. The days of the week are in English and Spanish which is a nice touch. Overall this watch was the perfect size and he would absolutely purchase it again or recommend it to a friend.	5.0	5.334940571146556
kelly	CLASSY!!	We bought this as a gift for my son at Christmas and he LOVES it!!  It is much nicer than even the pics show.  Classy, masculine and sporty all at the same time. Very nice detail on face plate of watch and on the very nice brown leather wrist band. Would definitely recommend!	5.0	5.449559984660884
Nithin	Very Nice Watch	This an excellent and stylish watch to wear every day either in a casual or formal setting. Quality is good and the band is very comfortable. This watch comes in a huge variety of colors so look into all the different ones on the Nixon website. I've been given many compliments on this one.	5.0	4.944346856658643
Freddy Mojica	Great watch!	I was looking for a Nixon watch for a long time, but the stores have them too expensive. I saw this and I loved the design and color. The strap is really soft and feels really nice. The only problem I have is that you can barely read the actual watch! Other than that, I love the watch!	5.0	4.905423270040641
Suzanne I.	Perfect gift!	This was a Christmas gift for my Son.  He was thrilled.  He loves this brand and is starting to build a watch collection.  He had admired this one, so I ordered it for him.  It is a beautiful color and a quality made watch.  I will buy this brand again.	5.0	4.979504543457632

sacha parchment	Early Christmas gift for husband	My husband is usually very picky. It was supposed to be a Christmas gift but I gave it to him early fearing he wouldn't like it. Turns out he loves it! Never takes it off! The watch is a cool matte black and excellent quality	5.0	5.463772450855499

Ryan Hodge	Awesome watch	This was my second Nixon watch and I love them both. For the price you can’t beat it. I think Nixon watches are some of the cleanest and nicest looking watches. The brand speaks for itself.	5.0	4.999414332175814
Maddie	great policy, great watch	bought this for my boyfriend, and after about two weeks the watch stopped working. But, both Backcountry & Nixon were SO helpful in getting me a non-faulty watch, that i will be a loyal customer to both entities from now on.  Great watch, not too large like a lot of the Nixons tend to be. I wanted it for myself! Looks good on men and women. My boyfriend is obsessed with it.  Highly reccommended	5.0	4.9154219299120205
